**Important:** YAML files are sensitive to indentation. Make sure you copy-paste exactly as shown. Don't retype it.

## Step 5: Commit the file

Scroll down below the text area. You'll see a section called **"Commit changes"**.

**You'll see:**
1. A text box with placeholder "Create snake.yml"
   - This is the commit message (what you're saving)
   - You can leave it as-is or change it to something like "Add snake workflow"

2. A larger text box (optional description)
   - Leave this empty

3. Two radio buttons:
   - "Commit directly to the `main` branch" ← **Select this one**
   - "Create a new branch..." (ignore this)

4. A green button: **"Commit changes"**

**Click the green "Commit changes" button.**

## What Happens Internally

**When you click commit:**

1. **GitHub creates the folders**
   - Makes a new folder called `.github` in your repository root
   - Inside that, makes a folder called `workflows`

2. **GitHub creates the file**
   - Saves `snake.yml` inside the `workflows` folder
   - Stores the YAML content you pasted

3. **GitHub records the change**
   - Creates a "commit" (a snapshot of this change)
   - Adds it to your repository's history

4. **GitHub Actions activates**
   - Scans for new workflow files
   - Registers your "Generate Snake" workflow
   - Makes it available in the Actions tab

**Technical detail:** Git (the version control system GitHub uses) doesn't actually store empty folders. When you type `.github/workflows/snake.yml`, Git stores the file path as metadata attached to the file. The folders are created automatically when the file is saved.

## Step 6: Verify it worked

After clicking commit, GitHub redirects you back to the repository main page.

**To verify the file exists:**

1. Look at your file list
2. You should now see a folder called `.github` (it might be at the top if sorted alphabetically)
3. Click on `.github`
4. You should see a `workflows` folder inside
5. Click on `workflows`
6. You should see `snake.yml` inside

**Alternative verification:**
- Type this URL directly in your browser:
```
  https://github.com/gitit24x7/gitit24x7/blob/main/.github/workflows/snake.yml
```
- If the file exists, you'll see its content
- If you get "404", the file wasn't created correctly
